# Downloads

You can find downloads for Old Animations on either the [CurseForge page][curseforge] or through
the [GitHub Releases page][releases]. Usually, releases will be made on GitHub slightly sooner than [CurseForge].

## Versioning Strategy

The Old Animations Project uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semantic_versioning] as their versioning strategy:

```
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

  1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
  3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
```
